Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This project aims to build a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

Data:
- The dataset used for training and evaluation is the 'Handwriting Recognition' dataset from Kaggle.
- The data is preprocessed and augmented using ImageDataGenerator to improve model robustness.

Model:
- The model is a sequential CNN consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers.
- The model architecture is designed to extract features from the images and classify them into 10 digit classes.

Training:
- The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
- Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting and save training time.

Evaluation:
- The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset using accuracy as the metric.

Prediction:
- The model can be used to predict the digit class of new handwritten images.
